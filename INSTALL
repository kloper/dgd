Building DGD
============

DGD makes extensive use of C++ boost (http://www.boost.org). You
need boost 1.25.0 or later to compile DGD. 

STLPort 4.5 (http://www.stlport.com) was used during DGD
developing. It is recommended but not required. In fact DGD works well
with the native VC++ version of STL.

On Cygwin or Unix machines just examine 'reconf' script in the root
directory and run it with the appropriate option. If configure does not work,
emitting strange errors - use util/bin/unixify script to get rid of windoze
EOLs.

On Windows the primary building process is different then building
usual Win32 libraries. DGD uses GNU build tools and VC++. You need to
install cygwin package (http://www.cygwin.com) and Visual Studio. 

There are Visual Studio project files in 'msvc-prj' directory, but
they will be updated only for stable versions.

The following steps are required to build DGD:

 1. Download and build C++ boost and (optionally) STLPort libraries.
 2. Download DGD distribution (dgd-XXX.tar.gz from
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/dgd, here XXX refers to the package
    version). 
 3.  gzip -dc dgd-XXX.tar.gz | tar -xf - 
    Do this in the same directory where boost library is installed or in
    directory one or two levels behind. DGD configure script will
    search for boost library.
 4. Inspect all ./configure options in dgd-XXX directory. Modify
    ./reconf script according to your needs. Run ./reconf.
 5. run 'make'

Configure script options
========================

 * --enable-debug - compile debug version of DGD
 * --with-cvs - use CVS to automatically get the version of DGD.
   Optional parameter can specify a full path (including executable itself) 
   to cvs client. If this option is not specified dgd/src/dgConfig.h.in need 
   to be edited to update the version.
 * --with-stlport - compile using STLPort library. Optional parameter can
   specify the root directory of STLPort distribution.
 * --with-msvc - use MS VC++ as a compiler. 
 * --with-pch - use precompiled headers if available. This option is treated 
                only when '--with-msvc' is specified.

Additional packages
===================

You will need some additional programs if you want to change DGD. 

 * makedepend -  makes make file dependencies from set of source files. 
   Available from ftp.x.org

 * GNU Gengetopt - generates command line parser. Use this if you want to 
   change dgd/dgd/src/dgDebugOpt.gge. This program is available from 
   http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html
