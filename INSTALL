Depression Glass Debug Library INSTALL
======================================

Precompiled version
===================

DGD comes with precompiled .lib file (compiled with MS VC++ 6.0, debug
support and multi-threaded runtime ) and set of headers. 

To use the precompiled version just add to your compile include path
dgd-XXX/dgd/src where dgd-XXX is a root DGD directory, add to the
library path dgd-XXX/lib and to the libraries list add dgd.lib.

Building DGD
============

Building DGD is different then building usual Win32 libraries. DGD
uses GNU build tools and VC++. You need to install cygwin package
<http://www.cygwin.com> and Visual Studio. 

DGD makes extensive use of C++ boost <http://www.boost.org>. You
need boost 1.25.0 or later to compile DGD.

STLPort 4.5 <http://www.stlport.com> was used during DGD
developing. It is recommended but not required. In fact DGD works well
with the native VC++ version of STL.

The following steps are required to build DGD:

1. Download and open C++ boost and STLPort libraries.
2. Download DGD distribution (dgd-XXX.tar.gz from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dgd, here XXX refers to the package
version). 
3. gzip -dc dgd-XXX.tar.gz | tar -xf - 
Do this in the same directory where boost library is installed or in
directory one or two levels behind. DGD configure script will
search for boost library.
4. Inspect all ./configure options in dgd-XXX directory. Modify
./reconf script according to your needs. Run ./reconf.
5. run 'make'

Configure script options
========================

* --enable-debug - compile debug version of DGD
* --with-cvs     - use CVS to automatically get the version of DGD.
                   Optional parameter can specify a full path (including 
                   executable itself) to cvs client. If this option is not 
                   specified dgd/src/dgConfig.h.in need to be edited to 
                   update the version.
* --with-stlport - compile using STLPort library. Optional parameter can
                   specify the root directory of STLPort distribution.
* --with-msvc    - use MS VC++ as a compiler. This is a required option for 
                   the current release.
* --with-pch     - use precompiled headers if available.

Additional packages
===================

You will need some additional programs if you want to change DGD. 

* makedepend - makes make file dependencies from set of source files. 
Available from ftp.x.org

* GNU Gengetopt - generates command line parser. Use this if you want to 
change dgd/dgd/src/dgDebugOpt.gge. This program is available from 
http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html
