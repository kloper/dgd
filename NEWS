Depression Glass Debug Library NEWS
===================================

08/12/2002:	Added new [[tutorial [tutorial]] articles.

21/11/2002:	Added two tutorial articles about channelbuf and formatting.
Look in [[related pages in code documentation [tutorial]].

04/11/2002:	Released version 0.20 on freshmeat.net. It is important to me 
to know whether DGD is useful. Right now, I am getting no feedback from people.
Please, visit [[the DGD Forum [forum]] and let me know what do you think about 
DGD.

01/11/2002:	Ported DGD to Cygwin and Linux. Using gcc 2.95. I am not 
distributing binaries for those right now. If you need 
ones [[please contact me [mail]].

28/09/2002:	Added subdirectory msvc-prj which contains VC++ 
projects for DGD. People who have no cygwin installed can use these
to build DGD. Note that I am planning to update VC++ projects
for stable releases only. 
I have written a perl script which allowed me to integrate doxygen 
output and webmake generated site.

22/09/2002:	Please fill [[the online survey [basic_feedback]].

21/09/2002:	Created a web site for DGD using WebMake.
