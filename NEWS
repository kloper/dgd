===================================

11/01/2002:	Ported DGD to Cygwin and Linux. Using gcc 2.95. I am not 
distributing binaries for those right now. If you need 
ones [[please contact me [mail]].

28/09/2002:	Added subdirectory msvc-prj which contains VC++ 
projects for DGD. People who have no cygwin installed can use these
to build DGD. Note that I am planning to update VC++ projects
for stable releases only. 
I have written a perl script which allowed me to integrate doxygen 
output and webmake generated site.

22/09/2002:	Please fill [[the online survey [basic_feedback]].

21/09/2002:	Created a web site for DGD using WebMake.
