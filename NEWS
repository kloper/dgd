Depression Glass Debug Library NEWS
===================================
23/04/2003:	Fixed Doxygen to generate right inner class names in HTML 
documentation. The DGD documentation is updated.

18/04/2003:	Release 0.25. Documentation build system is redesigned. 
Switched from Webmake to Mason. I have no plans of adding new features to DGD. 
Next few releases will have only documentation updates and better porting 
support. 

10/04/2003:	Version 0.24 is a bug fix release. Fixed two major bugs and 
added some more code documentation, primary on funnels and multifile logs.

09/12/2002:	Released version 0.22. The main target of this release is
funnel - special channel-like object which can be bound to physical streams
at first place. Then all other channels can be associated with the funnel. 
The second target was multi-file logs. There is a special funnel called 
DGD::multifile_log which can split the log by output size or by number of 
output lines. There is no documentation for the new code yet.

08/12/2002:	Added new [[tutorial [tutorial]] articles.

21/11/2002:	Added two tutorial articles about channelbuf and formatting.
Look in [[related pages in code documentation [tutorial]].

04/11/2002:	Released version 0.20 on freshmeat.net. It is important to me 
to know whether DGD is useful. Right now, I am getting no feedback from people.
Please, visit [[the DGD Forum [forum]] and let me know what do you think about 
DGD.

01/11/2002:	Ported DGD to Cygwin and Linux. Using gcc 2.95. I am not 
distributing binaries for those right now. If you need 
ones [[please contact me [mail]].

28/09/2002:	Added subdirectory msvc-prj which contains VC++ 
projects for DGD. People who have no cygwin installed can use these
to build DGD. Note that I am planning to update VC++ projects
for stable releases only. 
I have written a perl script which allowed me to integrate doxygen 
output and webmake generated site.

22/09/2002:	Please fill [[the online survey [basic_feedback]].

21/09/2002:	Created a web site for DGD using WebMake.
