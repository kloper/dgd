About
=====

Depression Glass Debug (DGD) is simple, easy to use C++ ostream
extension for debugging output. DGD is created with a goal to produce 
nice, readable and easy to understand trace logs.

DGD is developed for Win32, but every stable release is ported to Cygwin 
and Linux.

Features list:

 * Provides simple extension for std::ostream which allows 
   post-formatting of the output stream. The output stream is treated as
   text log with optional maximum and minimum line width, indentation,
   character and word wrapping.

 * Provides custom channels and channel factory.

 * Provides simple, yet powerful mechanism for synchronizing all streams
   upon application exit or crash.

 * Provides output operators for many STL types, memory references and
   memory blocks.

 * Provides a set of useful macros allowing simplified use of DGD
   channels and ability to ''compile out'' DGD tracing code using a single
   -D option of the compiler.

 * Provides a mechanism for automatic command line options parsing.

 * DGD is **NOT** thread safe! This does not mean that DGD can't be used in
   multi-threaded applications. This does mean that it must be used with care.


License terms
=============

GNU Public License. See COPYING file in the DGD root directory.

Required libraries
==================

 * DGD makes extensive use of C++ boost (http://www.boost.org). You
   need boost 1.25.0 or later to compile DGD.

 * STLPort 4.5 (http://www.stlport.com) was used during DGD
   developing. It is recommended but not required. 

Required build tools
====================

DGD comes with precompiled libraries and set of headers. 

If you want to build DGD by yourself please refer to INSTALL file for 
more information.

Installation
============

Please refer to installation instructions in INSTALL file in DGD root
directory. 

Similar libraries
=================

libcwd (http://libcwd.sourceforge.net/) -- full-featured debugging
support library for C++ developers. This is a good library, but
unfortunately it has no Windows port. Right now DGD has the same set
of features for debug tracing.
