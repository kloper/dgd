About
=====

dgcons is a framework of perl modules around of GNU Cons
(http://www.gnu.org/software/cons/) that extend the cons functionality:

  * Toolsets -- predefined set of Cons environments. Currently, the following
    tollsets are supported: gcc, msvc70, cygwin, mingw, boost, libpng,
    stlport, clo, doxygen, jpeg, qt4, zlib. 
  
  * Template support, a-la GNU autoconf *.in files, based on Text::Template.

  * Automatic version and build counters.
 
  * Possibility of configuration and environment tests like in GNU autoconf.

Very short introduction into dgcons
===================================

This small guide is a brief introduction into dgcons and does not cover the
GNU cons itself. Please refer http://www.gnu.org/software/cons/ for in-depth
guide to the cons features.

In order to start add the following lines at the beginning of your Construct
file:

   use Cons::Toolset;                       
                                           
   our $toolset = Cons::Toolset->getopt();  
                                           
   die if( !defined( $toolset ) );          

This will parse the @ARGV options and create the toolset object. Next, you can
use that object any time you need to construct the a cons object:

   my $ruleset  = $toolset->env();            
                                              
   die if( !defined( $ruleset ) );            
                                              
   my $buildenv   = new cons( %{$ruleset} );  

The toolset object is constructed once in the Construct file, exported by 
cons Export mechanism to all its sibling Conscript files.

Now, it is possible to run cons with dgcons support:

   perl -I ./dgcons ./dgcons/cons.pl myproject -- --toolset=gcc,boost
