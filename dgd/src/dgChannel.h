/**
 * Simple debug channel. This class is a std::ostream with extended
 * functionality. Terminology:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Stream input -- a set of characters pushed into the stream for
 * later output.
 * <li> Line -- a set of characters on a single line of output, or
 * alternatively, set of characters between two '\\n' or '\r'.
 * <li> Line width -- the length of the line excluding '\\n' or '\r'.
 * </ul>
 *
 * DGD::channel treats the input as sequence of lines. Similarly to
 * std::ostream it has a set of format flags and other parameters
 * defining how the sequence is formatted. The following formatting
 * options are available:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Character wrap. Controlled by void channel::wrap(bool)
 * method. State is received by bool channel::wrap() const method.
 *
 * DGD::channel can have character wrapping enabled or
 * disabled. When disabled, DGD::channel discards maximum line width,
 * allowing virtually infinite lines.
 *
 * If the character wrapping is enabled DGD::channel tracks maximum
 * line width. Line longer then maximum width (indentation spaces at
 * the beginning of line are considered as part of the line!) is
 * broken into two lines. The first one has at most maximum width. See
 * word wrapping section for more info. The second one is processed in
 * a recursive manner.
 *
 * <li> Maximum line width. Controlled by void
 * channel::max_width(unsigned int). State is received by unsigned int
 * channel::max_width() const method. 
 *
 * Usually it is good idea to limit the log width.  For example log
 * with 79 characters width limit can be nicely viewed in standard
 * 80x24 terminal, default emacs window, etc..., without need for
 * window resizing.
 *
 * <li> Minimum line width. Controlled by void
 * channel::min_width(unsigned int). State is received by unsigned int
 * channel::min_width() const method. 
 *
 * This parameter controls maximum indent level. Maximum indent column
 * is calculated as minimum between current indent value and maximum
 * line width minus minimum line width. This is true even if character
 * wrapping is disabled.
 *
 * <li> Word wrap. Controlled by void channel::word_wrap(bool)
 * method. State is received by bool channel::word_wrap() const
 * method.
 *
 * Word wrapping takes place only if character wrapping is enabled.
 *
 * If word wrapping is disabled the line longer then maximum width
 * will be broken in two and the first line of the pair will have
 * exactly maximum width. Otherwise word wrapping takes place. If the
 * line can't be broken into words the character wrapping is performed
 * (if enabled ). The word wrapping is controlled also by space
 * characters set, see void channel::space_chars(const char*) method.
 * 
 * <li> Indentation level, indentation step. Controlled by 
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> void         indent_step( unsigned int step );
 *    <li> void         incr_indent();
 *    <li> void         decr_indent();
 *    <li> void         indent( unsigned int val );
 *    </ul>
 * State is received by:
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> unsigned int indent_step() const;
 *    <li> unsigned int indent() const;
 *    </ul>
 *
 * Indentation level determines amount of leading spaces for each
 * line of output. This amount is considered as part of the line
 * width.
 *
 * Indentation level can be set directly by indent(unsigned int)
 * method, or by incrementing/decrementing using incr_indent() and
 * decr_indent() methods. In the later case it is changed by indent
 * step value. 
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each channel has string name. Generally it need not be unique, but
 * DGD::Debug factory accepts only unique names for channels.
 *
 * By default the channel is created in closed state. Closed channel
 * will produce no output. Use open() and close() methods to open
 * channel.
 *
 * By default channel acts as a simple memory buffer. To make the
 * channel act as a multiplexor for any number of std::ostream you
 * will need to call assoc(std::ostream* ,channel&) function. In other words
 * you can associate the channel with any number of files or other
 * std::ostream derivatives. The output from the channel will be
 * copied to all the associated files.
