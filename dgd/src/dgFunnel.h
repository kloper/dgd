 * column and amount of the written bytes. 
 *
 * DGD::funnelbuf keeps a pointer to a special callback object
 * which must be derived from DGD::funnelbuf::Callback class. This
 * pointer is initially NULL, meaning no callback. It can be set using
 * funnelbuf::callback(Callback*) method. Once the pointer is not NULL,
 * post_process() which is automatically invoked by channelbuf, will
 * call the Callback::operator().
 * 
 * Note that funnelbuf hides post_process(), assoc() amd callback()
 * methods, thus making them accessible by DGD::funnel objects only.

/**
 * Best association target. There is a good chance that DGD will
 * produce incorrect output when there are multiple DGD::channel
 * objects associated with the single physical stream. DGD::funnel
 * is designed to solve the multiple association problem. The main
 * idea is to associate your channels with a single funnel which sits on
 * top of the physical stream. The funnel synchronizes the output of 
 * all the channels, applies its own formatting (if any) and writes
 * the resulting mix to the physical stream.
 *
 * DGD::funnel can be used as a stream counter of data passed through
 * it. It is derived from funnelbuf::Callback and serves as a callback
 * of self funnelbuf. The empty operator()(unsigned long, unsigned
 * long, unsigned long) can be overridden in subclasses.
 *
 * Note that DGD::funnel inherits from std::ostream, so it can't be
 * used as a plain DGD::channel. Specifically, it can't be used for the
 * second parameter to assoc(), but it can be used for the first one.
 *
 * @see DGD::channel
