<title>Depression Glass Debug Spec</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFF99">

<h1>Depression Glass Debug library</h1>
<h2>What is Depression Glass?</h2>
<p>Find exact references on the web, for example
<a href="http://www.dgshopper.com/whatis.html">here is good explanation</a>. So, 
for now, &quot;Depression Glass&quot; means something simple, cheap, less then 
perfect (ok, <b>not buggy</b>, but containing minimal feature set) which can be and actually was 
heavily used during long period of time. </p>
<h2>Purpose of the library.</h2>
<p>DGD is a library for debugging algorithms. Usually, implementing of any 
algorithm with complexity above then trivial&nbsp; (implementation complexity 
not the algorithm complexity!)&nbsp; requires some tracing being included in the 
code. Most of the time this tracing is a form of printf() statements or so. DGD 
is supposed to be easily extended C++ printf() (or so) wrapper, with a handy set 
of tools allowing readable and precise output.</p>
<h2>Features wanted.</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Formatting. Everything std::ostream can do.</li>
  <li>Indentation:
  <ul>
  <li>
  increase and decrease indentation<li>
  possibility to limit indentation level in both direction. This means that 
  indentation counter will be increased/decreased but no actual indentation will 
  occur</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Limited or unlimited string length. </li>
  <li>Wrap:
  <ul>
  <li>
  word wrap<li>
  char wrap<li>
  if word wrap is disabled use char wrap<li>
  if word wrap is impossible use char wrap</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Possibility to turn on and off. When turned off must take minimum or no 
  execution time.</li>
  <li>Possibility to be compiled out (need to check whether can be done without 
  heavy use of macros)</li>
  <li>Channels. See below.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Features which are <font color="#FF0000">not yet</font> wanted, but may be 
candidates for the future.</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Fine grain message typing: NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR, etc... types of 
  messages and ability of user to choose between them.</li>
  <li>Multithreading support</li>
  <li>Support for multiple languages</li>
  <li>Unicode.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Channels</h2>
<p>Most of the time your main algorithm (read main loop, main application, 
etc...) calls some other algorithms. If you developed those algorithms as well, 
good chances that they will emit DGD output too. Placing this output in one 
place (e.g. one log file) is a bad idea. Since once the (sub) algorithm is stable 
you are rarely interested in its debug output. So, you want to be able either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turn of the output from the algorithm.</li>
  <li>Let the output from the algorithm go into different place called
  <font color="#FF0000"><b><i>channel</i></b></font>. Your main algorithm 
  channel is called <i>main</i> channel and sub-algorithm channels are, as you 
  probably guessed, sub-channels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features wanted on channels.</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Possibility to link channels. Need to insert references in places where 
  should stay output which went to other channel.</li>
  <li>/dev/null channel</li>
  <li>/dev/text and /dev/html channels</li>
  <li>User must have ability to decide (dynamic decision ability is needed !!!) where formatted 
  output from channels go physically. Examples:
  <ul>
  <li>
  All channels go in the single file or memory buffer. <b>Note</b> that 
  channels' output must not be intermixed and the order is important.<li>
  Some channel(s) goes into separate file. Main channel has references to <b>
  exact places</b> in that file.<li>
  Some channel(s) go into memory buffer.</ul>
  By default all channels go into same file. 
  </li>
  <li>User must have ability to turn off/on some or all channels. When turned 
  off channel must not take CPU, or take minimum CPU.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Thoughts on design of channels.</h2>
<p>Every channel must have a name. The name is hardcoded, it is user 
responsibility to choose right channel names.</p>
<p>Thre must to be a channel factory, creating and managing all channels. There 
must be a current channel in the factory. There must to be default destination 
which is memory buffer.</p>
<p>Ok, here is the picture of code:</p>
<code>
Debug dout;<br>
File *file1 = dout.create_file(&quot;out1.log&quot;), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *file2 = dout.create_file(&quot;out2.log&quot;);<br>
Mem_buffer *memory = dout.create_memory_buffer();<br>
<br>
Text_channel *a = dout.create_text_channel(&quot;a&quot;);<br>
Html_channel *b = dout.create_html_channel(&quot;b&quot;);<br>
Html_channel *c = dout.create_html_channel(&quot;c&quot;);<br>
<br>
file1.add( a );<br>
file1.add( b ); <br>
<br>
file2.add( b );<br>
file2.add( c );</code><p><code>memory.add( a );<br>
<br>
</code>
Now, somewhere in the middle of the algorithm:</p>

<code>DGD( dout[&quot;a&quot;], &quot;Hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; endl );<br>
DGD( dout[&quot;b&quot;], 123 &lt;&lt; &quot;some string&quot; &lt;&lt; endl );<br>
DGD( dout, 333.033 &lt;&lt; endl ); // This will go into current channel<br>
<br>
// The file out1.log will contain:<br>
// Hello world<br>
// 123some string<br>
<br>
// The file out2.log<br>
// 123some string<br>
<br>
// memory buffer will contain<br>
// Hello world<br>
<br>
// default memory buffer will contain<br>
// 333.03</code>
<p>Note that it is upon application to define channels and files, their amount 
and logic. Simple mechanism for selecting channels will be used, based on 
regular expressions on channel names. For example:</p>
<p>myapp --enable-debug=debug.log --debug-channels='(kern.*| main)'</p>
<p>This will create main log file called debug.log and enable all channels 
beginning with kern and main channel</p>
<h1>DGD for C</h1>
<p>Recently some need aroused for C API similar to the C++ DGD. Here is a 
beginning of the design. The fieatures of the C library must be same ones as 
with the C++:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Channels</li>
  <li>Formatting as with printf() and more. Possibility to define extra %c for 
  our version of printf.</li>
  <li>Indentation</li>
  <li>Limited line width</li>
  <li>Char and word wrap</li>
  <li>Dynamic channels</li>
</ul>
<h2>Differences with C++ version.</h2>
<p>The main difference is that we can't rely on libc stdio functions, nor on 
sprintf(). The former because stdio FILE mechanism has no overflow() callback, 
the later is because it is very system dependent. </p>
<p>So main difficulty with C implementation is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Need to reimplement sprintf()</li>
  <li>Need to reimplement buffered io</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that the io library is not compatible with stdio means that users 
will need to rewrite their debug routines in order to migrate to DGD.</p>
<h2>Thoughts on design of the C API.</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how C DGD can be used:</p>
<p>
<pre>typedef struct _Linked_list_node {
    unsigned magic_number;
    int data;
    struct _Linked_list_node *next;
} Linked_list_node;

dgd_channel *dgd_list_node( dgd_channel *channel, void *node ) {
    Linked_list_node *ll_node = (Linked_list_node*)node;

    if( ll_node-&gt;magic_number != LINKED_LIST_NODE_MAGIC ) {
        dgd_printf( channel, &quot;Node %p, magic number %u is bad\n&quot;, node, ll_node-&gt;magic_number );
        return channel;
    }
    
    dgd_printf( channel, &quot;[%d]&quot;, ll_node-&gt;data );

    return channel;
}</pre>
<pre>dgd_channel *dgd_list( dgd_channel *channel, void *head ) {
    Linked_list_node *ll_node = (Linked_list_node*)head;

    dgd_printf( channel, &quot;%p {\n&quot;, head );
    while( ll_node != NULL ) {
         dgd_printf( channel, &quot;%{linked_list_node} &quot;, ll_node );
         ll_node = ll_node-&gt;next;
    }
    dgd_printf( channel, &quot;}\n&quot; );
    return channel;
}
</pre>
