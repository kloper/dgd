<h1>Depression Glass Debug Library FAQ</h1>
<p>Q: What is &quot;Depression Glass&quot;? </p>
<p>A: Find exact references on the web, for example
<a href="http://www.dgshopper.com/whatis.html">here is the original explanation:</a></p>
<p><cite><i>Technically, Depression Glass is the cheap, sometimes less than perfect 
glassware that was mass produced in America during the Great Depression. It was 
often given away for buying something like a sack of flour. The cheerful colors 
of Depression glass helped to brighten up a bleak point in American history. In 
the years to follow the Depression, many people got rid of their Depression 
glass. For some, it was a reminder of hard times and it symbolized being poor. 
Because so much glass was discarded, what's left behind has become very 
collectible. </i></cite></p>
<p>Q: Anyway, what is DGD good for?</p>
<p>A: DGD is a library for algorithm debugging. Usually, implementation of any 
algorithm with complexity above  trivial&nbsp; (implementation complexity, 
not the algorithm complexity!)&nbsp; requires some tracing being included in the 
code. Most of the time this tracing is a form of printf() statements or similar. DGD 
is supposed to be easily extended C++ ostream (or so) wrapper, with a handy set 
of tools allowing readable and precise output.</p>
<p>Q: What platforms DGD supports?</p>
<p>A: I am intended to keep DGD as portable as possible, while developing on and 
for Windows. There is
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a> and Linux port which will be 
maintained for stable DGD releases.</p>

<p>Q: Is DGD multi-thread safe? </p>

<p>A: No. DGD is as multithread safe as std::ostream is. If two threads write 
into same DGD::channel it is good chance that the output will be me messed. But 
nothing will fail and no deadlocks will. So, DGD certainly <b>can be used</b> in 
multi-threaded applications, but it is good practice to write output of each 
thread to separate file/channel.</p>
