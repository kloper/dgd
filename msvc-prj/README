MS VC++ Project files for building DGD
========================================

This directory subtree contains project files for building DGD from scratch
using the Visual Studio IDE. All projects are built using multithreading 
run-time.

The project files assume that boost and (optionally) stlport libraries 
reside in same root directory as the dgd dist. To change this you will 
need change include and library pathes manually in project settings.

Please note that the IDE project files are supplied for convenience only
and may be incompatible with latest version of DGD.
